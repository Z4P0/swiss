# swiss

these are some simple CSS experiments to replicate some Swiss-style posters I've come across.
reference images have been included to see what i'm going for/
along with giving my CSS skills a test, replicating the designs will have a subtle impact on my understanding of typographical structure

should be posted at lab.zapo.tc/swiss as soon as i get that whole sub-domain thing figured out
